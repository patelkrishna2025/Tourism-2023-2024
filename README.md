# Tourism-2023-2024 Dashboards (Interactive Dashboard creation using MS Excel)
##Project Objective
Tourism is a powerful engine of economic growth, cultural exchange, and regional development. In a diverse country like India, each region offers unique experiencesâ€”ranging from wildlife and beach tourism to spiritual and cultural travel. However, despite its potential, the sector faces challenges related to uneven tourist distribution, underutilized regions, and a lack of data-driven decision-making. This project aims to explore tourism patterns across India using interactive data visualizations in Tableau to offer deeper insights into visitor behavior, economic impact, and regional performance.
